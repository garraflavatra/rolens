## Why another MongoDB client?

This project arose from all flaws of similar tools many of which are slow, complicated, heavy, and fairly unwieldy. They mostly require a reasonably high level of knowledge on how to operate the program.

**Rolens aims to be the intuitive, lightweight counterpart of these overengineered tools.**

- [x] **Lightweight**: Rolens weighs about 15 MB.
- [x] **Open source**: You know what's inside!
- [x] **Low overhead**: Typical query results against a local database are returned whithin milliseconds.
- [x] **Intuitive interface**: You know MongoDB? You know Rolens.

This project is heavily inspired by the excellent [MongoHub](https://github.com/bububa/MongoHub-Mac) application, which sadly has not been updated since 2011.

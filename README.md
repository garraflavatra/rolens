## Why another MongoDB client?

This project arose from all flaws of similar tools: they are slow, complicated, heavy, and fairly unwieldy. They require a high level of knowledge on how to operate the program.

**Rolens aims to be the intuitive, lightweight counterpart of these overengineered tools.**

- [x] **Lightweight**: Rolens weighs about 15 MB.
- [x] **Open source**: you know what's inside!
- [x] **Low overhead**: typical query results against a local database are returned whithin milliseconds.
- [x] **Intuitive**: you know MongoDB? You know Rolens.

You can open the preference panel by using the menu <kbd>Rolens > Settingsâ€¦</kbd> or by typing {% render "shortcut", shortcut: shortcuts.preferences[0] %}.

Rolens currently offers the following configuration options:

* The initial number of items to retrieve using one query (query limit).
* The default sorting criteria. Defaults to `{ "_id": 1 }`, i.e. sort by the `_id` field ascending.
* Whether to auto-submit the query when a collection has been opened.
* The default directory where exports should be saved.

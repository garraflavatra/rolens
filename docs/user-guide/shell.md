Rolens has a shell feature: it provides an editor for writing shell scripts and executing them against a local or external host, database, or even a single collection. You can find it under the _Shell_ tab.

## Requirements

To use the script editor, you need to install the official [`mongosh` tool](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/) from MongoDB. You can [download it](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell) from the MongoDB web site, or run `brew install mongosh` if you use a Mac.
